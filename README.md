# sotfsavetools

Basic save tools for Sons Of The Forest.

At this time, sotfsavetools can be used to resurrect Kelvin and Virginia,
should they have died in one of your game saves. Shame on you.

There is also a season desync fix available for multiplayer hosts. 

    * This bug occurs when a host has created a custom game and changed the starting season or season length.
    * A host's custom rules are not carried over to any connecting clients. 
    * The current best fix is to convert the custom game over to a regular game. 

At this time, sotfsavetools can convert your custom game back to a normal one.
*Important* If you choose to use the "Season Fix" button, your custom game will be converted to normal mode.
